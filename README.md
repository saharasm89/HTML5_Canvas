You need to submit a game the last Sunday night of the course, and then demo it in class the week of finals (unless you demo your node.js project). 
This game is simple HTML/CSS/JS so you can edit it on a windows system using code and just run it in a browser.  
No node, no Github, but it must run on Azure.  You have 4 choices, each a little harder than then prior.
